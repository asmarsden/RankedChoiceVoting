## Welcome to the Ranked Choice Voting Application

The goal of this project is to allow people to create, share, and vote on ranked choice polls.

Ranked choice voting is a method of voting that involves voting for not only a first choice, but second, third, etc. choices in order to avoid the problem that traditional polls have of splitting votes between popular but similar options. This could range from electoral votes being split between a third party candidate and the party candidate they are most similar to, to clubs splitting their votes between two popular restaurants for catering. Oftentimes, with a traditional poll, the people answering the poll have to take into account where votes are likely to go overall and vote accordingly so that they don't end up wasting their vote. 

With ranked choice voting, that isn't an issue. This is due to the logic behind ranked choice voting: a winner is not chosen until they have more than a certain percentage of votes, and each option with the lowest votes is thrown out and those votes reassigned to those voter's next best options until an option hits that percentage.

This eliminates the splitting of votes in the majority of cases, and tends to yeild a more accurate portrayal of what the voters actually want in the first place.

From club elections, to friend groups choosing where to eat for lunch, ranked choice voting can be extremely useful, but only if an easy way to create, share, and vote with such a system exists. 

However, at the moment there are no fast, seamless options for implementing ranked choice voting in a casual or semi-casual setting. This project was created to remedy that, and give anyone the option to use ranked choice voting with just a few taps of a screen.
